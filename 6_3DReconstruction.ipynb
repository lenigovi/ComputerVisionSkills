    "## Local Invariant Features and Descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "Local descriptors are tools for matching features in a given input image and to locate points of a given image in 3D space and recognizing the same points in another image taken in a different pointview. Local feature extraction can be used in SLAM, object detection and 3D Reconstruction.\n",

    "Set of distinctive key feature points are detected in both images, and corresponding pairs are found. Around each keypoint, a region is defined. Region content is extracted and normalized. A local descriptor from the normalized region is computed, and local descriptors are matched. By using the pairs, the images are aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the region descriptors to be invariant to a geometric transformation, the region shape needs to be covariant to the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invariant: Any physical quantity is invariant when its value remains unchanged under coordinate or symmetry transformations. Examples are physical quantities represented by scalars, such as temperature, pressure etc. whose value remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariant: The term covariant is usually used when the equations of physical systems are unchanged under coordinate transformations. Physical quantities represented by tensors and appearing in tensorial equations are covariant. Relativistic equations are covariant in the sense that they retain the same form in every coordinate system\n",
