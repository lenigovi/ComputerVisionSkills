    "Set of distinctive key feature points are detected in both images, and corresponding pairs are found. Around each keypoint, a region is defined. Region content is extracted and normalized. A local descriptor from the normalized region is computed, and local descriptors are matched. By using the pairs, the images are aligned.\n",

Physical quantities represented by tensors and appearing in tensorial equations are covariant.
