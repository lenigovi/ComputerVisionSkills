    "The recognition problem can be broken down along several axes. \n",
    "- Object detection: If the searched object is known, the solution involves scanning an image to determine where a match may occur.\n",
    "- Instance recognition: If the searched is a specific rigid object, characteristic feature points can be searched and they can be verified if they align in a geometrically plausible way.\n",
    "- Class recognition: Recognizing instances of varied classes such as furniture and animals. Recognition usually depends heavily on the context of surrounding objects and scene elements.\n",
