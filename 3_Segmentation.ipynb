    "The document will cover the following topics:\n",
    "- Segmentation as pixel wise classification\n",
    "    - Probabilistic classification\n",
    "    - Mixture of Gaussians, EM\n",
    "\n",
    "- Segmentation as energy minimization\n",
    "    - Markov Random Fields\n",
    "    - Energy formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph cuts for image segmentaton\n",
    "    - Basic idea\n",
    "    - s-t Mincut Algorithm\n",
    "    - Extension to non-binary case\n",

    "The goal of segmentation is to identify the boundaries between different objects in an image. This topic is important because:\n",
    "- it is a more basic step for the convolutional filters in Neural Networks for extracting image features\n",
    "- it is the basis for many other image processing tasks such as object detection, object tracking, and image classification\n",

    "Definition of The Problem\\\n",
    "Identifying groups of pixels in the input which is the image. This is a semantic segmentation, this means all the pixels that belong to a title are grouped together. For example, semantically meaningful groups such as color similarity,\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Segmentation Approaches:\n",
    "- Unsupervised Clustering\n",
    "    - Grouping what \"looks similar\"\n",
    "- Semantic Segmentation\n",
    "    - Learn a classifier to assign a semantic class $C_k$ to every pixel\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the grouping semantics, we use feature space. Grayscale image pixels are classified based on intensity similarity as a 1D representation, while colored images are classified based on color value similarity as a 3D representation.\n",

    "A filter Bank of 24 filters allow us to operate in 24-dimension. \n",

    "\n",
    "Probabilistic Classification\n",
    "- Bayesian Classification\n",
    "    - Given a measurement $x$, what semantic class $C_k$ should we assign to a pixel?\n",
    "    - We must recall Bayes Decision Theory in this section:\n",
    "        - $P(C_k|x) = \\frac{p(x|C_k)p(C_k)}{\\sum_{j}p(x|C_j)p(C_j)} $\n",
    "        - where: \n",
    "            - $p(x|C_k)$ is the likelihood of the measurement $x$ having been generated by class $C_k$\n",
    "            -  $p(C_k)$ is the prior probability of class $C_k$\n",
    "    - In order to build a classifier, we can try either:\n",
    "        - Discriminative Methods: directly estimating the posterior\n",
    "        - Generative Methods: estimating likelihood and prior, and then using the Bayes Decision formula\n",
